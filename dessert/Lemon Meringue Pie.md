## Instructions

#### Pastry

Sift flour into a bowl. Chop cold butter into cubes and add to the flour. Rub flour and butter together with your fingers until it reaches a consistency like fine breadcrumbs. Make a well in the centre, add the egg yolk and slowly add water while mixing until the pastry comes together. Enough water should be added to make the pastry form a ball, but not so much that the pastry is sticky. Cover the pastry in cling film and chill for 40 minutes.

Pre-heat an oven to 180C. Roll the chilled pastry over a floured surface until the pastry reaches your desired thickness. Using your rolling pin, lift the pastry and transfer to a quiche tin. Using some leftover pastry, press the sides of the pastry into the tin. Use the rolling pin to roll over the top of the quiche tin; this will trim the excess pastry. Excess pastry can be stored in the fridge for up to 5 days or refrigerated for up to 3 months.

Prick all around the base (but not the sides) of the pastry with a fork to allow air to escape while baking. Spread tin foil over the pastry and fill with baking beans or rice. Blind bake the pastry for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven, set aside the tin foil and baking beans/rice, and return the pastry case to the oven for a further 5 minutes.


#### Lemon Filling
Mix cornflour and caster sugar together in a saucepan. Zest the lemons, and set aside. Juice the lemons, sift to remove bits and seeds if necessary, and add the juice to the saucepan. Add the water and stir until smooth, then turn on the hob and set the heat to medium. Stir the mixture until it thickens - it will thicken very suddenly, so do keep an eye on it. Remove from the heat and add the lemon zest, eggs, and butter. Stir until the butter has melted. Spread the filling out evenly over the pastry case.

#### Meringue

Pre-heat the oven to 180C. Add egg whites to a clean metal bowl and whisk until soft peaks form. Add the sugar slowly while continuing to whisk until stiff peaks form. You can test for stiff peaks by tipping the bowl upside-down; the meringue should not fall out. Spread* the meringue on top of the lemon filling, making sure the meringue touches the pastry case to minimise shrinkage. Use a utensil of your choice (spatula, spoon, knife, or fork) to “lift” pieces of the meringue up to create peaks. Bake in the oven until the meringue has browned; this should take 5-10 minutes.

*For a fancier looking meringue, use a piping bag to place the meringue on top of the lemon filling.
