## Dark Chocolate Orange Brownies

These dark chocolate and orange brownies are deliciously chewy and rich wih flavour. I suggest slicing them into bite-sized pieces, as even a small slice is very filling.

#### Serves: 24

#### Prep Time: 20 minutes

#### Cooking Time: 25 minutes

## Ingredients

* 400g Caster Sugar
* 350g Dark Chocolate
* 225g Butter
* 200g Flour
* 5 Eggs
* Zest of 2 Medium Oranges

## Instructions

Cut the butter and chocolate into chunks. Place both in a heat-proof bowl, and place the bowl over a saucepan half-filled with boiling water. Place the saucepan over a low-medium heat and slowly melt the butter and chocolate. Once everything is melted, remove the bowl from the heat and set aside to cool for approximately 10 minutes. The mixture should not solidify.

Pre-heat the oven to 160C. Mix the eggs and sugar together in a bowl until light and fluffy, then add the orange zest. Once the chocolate and butter mixture has cooled slightly, add it to the egg and sugar mixture. Sift the flour into the bowl, and gently fold it in.

Grease a baking tin, and transfer the brownie mixture into it. Cook for 25 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the centre should come out mostly clean; but as the brownies are quite moist some crumbs will cling to it.
