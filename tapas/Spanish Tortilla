## Spanish Tortilla

This spanish tortilla with potato and onions is delicious whether eaten hot or cold. If you prefer it hot, I recommend re-heating in an oven to avoid the rubbery texture that sometimes results from microwaving eggs.

#### Serves: 6-8

#### Prep Time: 10 mins

#### Cooking Time: 30 mins

## Ingredients

* 6 Eggs
* 3 Medium Potatoes
* 1 Medium Onion
* 1 Garlic Clove
* A Bunch of Fresh Parsley
* Salt and Pepper

## Instructions

Thinly slice the potatoes, onion, and garlic. Add the olive oil and vegetables to a frying pan over a high heat, and coat the vegetables in the oil. Reduce the heat to low, season with salt and pepper, and cover the pot with a lid. Cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally. 

Whisk the eggs in a large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Finely chop the parsley and add it to the eggs, along with the potato mixture. Stir well to coat everything in egg, then transfer the mixture into the frying pan over a medium heat.

Cook the tortilla until the bottom is golden. Place a plate face-down on the frying pan, and tip the torilla onto the plate. Slide the tortilla back into the frying pan to cook the other side. Remove from the heat when the bottom has turned golden.
