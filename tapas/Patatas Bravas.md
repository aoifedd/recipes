## Patatas Bravas

Crispy twice-fried potatoes in a deliciously spicy tomato sauce. The potatoes can be cooked in the oven instead of being deep fried for a healthier alternative. Spices can be adjusted to taste.

#### Serves: 4

#### Active Prep Time: 10 minutes 

#### Cooking Time: 30 minutes

## Ingredients

* 500g Chopped Tomatoes (fresh or canned)
* 3 Garlic Cloves
* 2 Medium Potatoes
* 2 tbsp Olive Oil
* 2 tbsp Smoked Paprika
* 2 tsp Cayenne Pepper
* A pinch of salt


## Instructions

Wash the potatoes and peel them. Cut them into small, evenly-sized chunks. Add the chunks to a sauce pan and cover with olive oil. Cook for 10 minutes over a low-medium heat, then remove the potatoes from the oil, drain them, and set them aside to cool. Reserve the oil.

Peel the garlic cloves and fry them whole in olive oil until brown. Add the tomatoes, salt, and spices and cook over a medium heat for 10 minutes. Allow to cool slightly, then blitz with a hand blender. If you like your sauce extra smooth, pass it through a sieve.

Once the potatoes have cooled, heat the oil over a high heat. Once hot, add the potato chunks and cook until crispy and golden. If you have a lot of potato chunks, cook them in batches so the oil will maintain its heat.

Drain the excess oil from the potatoes before serving.
