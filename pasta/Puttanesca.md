This vegetarian version of puttanesca omits the anchovies. 

#### Serves: 2

#### Active Prep Time: 10 minutes

#### Cooking Time: 20 minutes

## Ingredients

* 250g Cherry Tomatoes
* 200g Pasta
* 3 Garlic Cloves
* 2 Red Chillis
* 1 Tablespoon Olive Oil
* 1 Tablespoon Tomato Paste
* 1 Tablespoon Chilli Flakes
* 1 Handful of Kalamata Olives
* 1 Teaspoon Sugar
* Salt
* Parmesan Cheese

## Instructions

Deseed and slice the chillis. Slice garlic into fine slivers. Quarter the cherry tomatoes. Tear the olives away from their stones.

Add pasta to generously salted boiling water and cook over a medium-high heat, stirring occasionally to prevent the pasta sticking.

Add olive oil and garlic to a frying pan over a medium heat. When the garlic is lightly toasted, add the chillis and olives and cook for 2-3 minutes.

Add tomate paste and cherry tomatoes to the frying pan. Season with salt to help the tomatoes break down. Add enough pasta water to halfway-coat the tomatoes, then cover with a pot lid and allow to simmer until the tomatoes have broken down. Remove the lid and add sugar and chilli flakes.

When the pasta is al-dente, drain the pasta, reserving some of the water. Toss the pasta in the sauce, adding more pasta water to loosen the sauce as necessary.

Season to taste, and sprinkle with parmesan cheese to serve.
